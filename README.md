# LogLineOS

This repository contains a prototype implementation of LogLineOS, an experimental operating system built around the six axioms of LogLine. The design of each component is described in LogLine files located under `docs/` and `governance/`. The overall roadmap is captured in `docs/DELIVERY_SCHEDULE.logline`.

All artifacts are placeholders intended only for demonstration.
